                <h2>Lighting Moments, One Candle at a Time</h2>
                <p>At cozy wicks, we believe that a single flame can transform a space, evoke memories, and bring
                    comfort to the soul. Our journey began with a deep love for cozy atmospheres and beautiful, soothing
                    scents. Every candle we create is hand-poured with care, using eco-friendly wax, high-quality
                    fragrance oils, and sustainable materials. Whether you are winding down after a long day or setting
                    the mood for a special moment, our candles are designed to inspire calm, connection, and joy. We are
                    passionate about craftsmanship, sustainability, and making your everyday spaces feel a little more
                    like home.
